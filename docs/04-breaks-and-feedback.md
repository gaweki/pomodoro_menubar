# Phase 4: Breaks & Feedback

## How Zen Mode Works

When a work session ends, the app opens **Zen Mode** – a full-screen break page in your browser.

- **Short Break (5 min):** Opens `break.html` with a countdown timer.
- **Long Break (15 min):** Same page, longer duration.
- **Lunch (60 min):** Extended break with the same calming interface.

### Why a Browser Page?

This is an intentional "focus hijack." By taking over your screen, you're forced to step away from work. The page includes:

- A countdown timer
- Random entertainment links (optional)
- Calming animations

> **Tip:** Don't close the page immediately – use the time to stretch, hydrate, or look away from the screen!

## Mood Tracking

After **60 seconds** into a break, a dialog appears asking about your mood:

1. A list of mood options appears (😊 Happy, 😣 Difficult, 💪 Productive, etc.)
2. Select one and click **Select**.
3. Optionally, you can **Skip** this step.

## Reflections and Blockers

After the mood dialog, two more prompts may appear:

1. **Quick Reflection:** *"What did you accomplish?"* – A short text field.
2. **Blocker Tracking:** *"Any blockers or issues?"* – Another text field.

Both are optional but incredibly useful for:
- Weekly reviews
- Identifying patterns in your productivity
- Spotting recurring blockers

## Viewing Your Feedback Data

All mood and reflection data is saved to `session_logs_today.json`. You can view summaries in:
