## 📦 Installation

### 🚀 Quick Start (Automation)
If you already have Python installed, you can use the included `manual.sh` script which handles setup and dependency installation automatically:
```bash
chmod +x manual.sh
./manual.sh
```

### 1. Prerequisite
Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed on your macOS.

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gaweki/pomodoro_menubar.git pomodoro_work
cd pomodoro_work
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x main.py

# Run
./main.py
```
The timer icon (🍅) should appear in your menu bar.



### 5. Set Up LaunchAgent (Auto-start on Login)

Setting up a LaunchAgent allows the application to run automatically in the background as soon as you log into your Mac.

*   **Why do this?** To ensure your Pomodoro schedule and session tracking are always active without manual intervention. It makes the app truly "set-and-forget."
*   **Who is it for?** Highly recommended for daily users who want the timer to follow their workday schedule automatically.
*   **What happens?** The app will start silently on boot/login, and you'll see the 🍅 icon in your menu bar immediately.

**Option A: Using the provided plist file**
```bash
# Copy the plist to LaunchAgents directory
cp com.pomodoro.menubar.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/

# Edit the plist to update paths
nano ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pomodoro.menubar.plist

# Load the agent
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pomodoro.menubar.plist
```

**Option B: Manual plist creation**

1. Create a file at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pomodoro.menubar.plist`.
2. Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `PATH_TO_PROJECT` with your actual Mac username and the folder where you cloned the repo.
3. **Note:** We recommend using the python executable inside your `venv` to ensure dependencies like `rumps` are found.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.pomodoro.menubar</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <!-- Path to python inside your virtual environment -->
        <string>/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/PATH_TO_PROJECT/venv/bin/python3</string>
        <!-- Path to your main.py file -->
        <string>/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/PATH_TO_PROJECT/main.py</string>
    </array>
    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
    <string>/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/PATH_TO_PROJECT</string>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/tmp/pomodoro_menubar.err</string>
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/tmp/pomodoro_menubar.out</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Then load it:
```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pomodoro.menubar.plist
```

### Managing the LaunchAgent
```bash
# Stop the agent
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pomodoro.menubar.plist

# Restart the agent
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pomodoro.menubar.plist&&launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pomodoro.menubar.plist

# Check if running
launchctl list | grep pomodoro
```

## � Fixed Schedule (Mon-Fri)

The application follows a structured workday. It automatically switches activities based on the time:

| Period | Time | Session Numbers | Activity Pattern |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Morning** | 09:00 - 12:00 | 1 - 6 | 25m Work / 5m Break (Long break after session 4) |
| **Lunch** | 12:00 - 13:00 | - | 60m Break |
| **Afternoon & Evening** | 13:00 - End | 1 - 15+ | 25m Work / 5m Break (Cycles continue based on `SCHEDULE`) |

*   **Fixed Schedule:** The app follows the `SCHEDULE` list defined in `main.py`.
*   **Off-Hours:** Outside these times (or on weekends), the app defaults to **Manual Mode**.


> **Customizing the Schedule:** You can modify the `SCHEDULE` list at the beginning of `main.py` to match your own work hours and break preferences. Simply update the `start` and `end` times for each session.

# Remove LaunchAgent
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pomodoro.menubar.plist
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pomodoro.menubar.plist
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### App doesn't start
- Check logs: `tail -f ~/pomodoro_menubar_error.log` (or path defined in your `.plist`)
- Verify Python path in plist matches your system: `which python3`
- Ensure script is executable: `chmod +x main.py`

### Web interface doesn't open
- Check if port 7878 is available: `lsof -i :7878`
- Try changing the port in `main.py`

### Tasks not appearing
- Check `tasks.json` for valid JSON syntax
- Verify task has correct `allowed_days` and `repeat_unit` settings
- Check if task is marked as deleted
